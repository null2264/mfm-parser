# MfmParser

A simple parser for [Misskey Flavoured Markdown](https://github.com/misskey-dev/mfm.js/).

It only parses the MFM specific syntax of the form $[name.params content] and newlines. 
That means that it doesn't parse links, usernames, HTML, Markdown or Katex.

The Parser returns a tree, which looks like

    [
      %MfmParser.Text{
        props: %{
          text: "it's not chocolatine, it's "
        }
      },
      %MfmParser.MFM.Twitch{
        props: %{
          speed: "0.2s"
        },
        children: [
          %MfmParser.Text{
            props: %{
              text: "pain au chocolat"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]

You can also convert the tree into HTML.

## Examples

    iex> MfmParser.Parser.parse("$[twitch.speed=5s üçÆ]")
    [
      %MfmParser.Node.MFM.Twitch{
        children: [%MfmParser.Node.Text{props: %{text: "üçÆ"}}],
        props: %{speed: "5s"}
      }
    ]
    iex> MfmParser.Parser.parse("$[twitch.speed=5s üçÆ]") |> MfmParser.to_html()                                    
    "<span style=\\"display: inline-block; animation: 5s ease 0s infinite normal none running mfm-twitch;\\">üçÆ</span><style>@keyframes mfm-twitch { 0% { transform:translate(7px,-2px) } 5% { transform:translate(-3px,1px) } 10% { transform:translate(-7px,-1px) } 15% { transform:translateY(-1px) } 20% { transform:translate(-8px,6px) } 25% { transform:translate(-4px,-3px) } 30% { transform:translate(-4px,-6px) } 35% { transform:translate(-8px,-8px) } 40% { transform:translate(4px,6px) } 45% { transform:translate(-3px,1px) } 50% { transform:translate(2px,-10px) } 55% { transform:translate(-7px) } 60% { transform:translate(-2px,4px) } 65% { transform:translate(3px,-8px) } 70% { transform:translate(6px,7px) } 75% { transform:translate(-7px,-2px) } 80% { transform:translate(-7px,-8px) } 85% { transform:translate(9px,3px) } 90% { transform:translate(-3px,-2px) } 95% { transform:translate(-10px,2px) } to { transform:translate(-2px,-6px) }}</style>"

## Reading
### The Parser

A [parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing#Parser) takes in structured text and outputs a so called "tree". A tree is a data structure which can be more easily worked with. 

A parser typically consists of three parts
* a Reader
* a Lexer (aka Tokeniser)
* the Parser

A Reader typically has a `next` function which takes the next character out of the input and returns it. 
A `peek` function allows it to peek at the next character without changing the input. 
There's also some way of detecting if the eof (End Of File) is reached. 
Depending on the needs of the parser, it may be implemented to allow asking for the nth character instead of just the next. 

A Lexer uses the Reader. It also has a `peek` and `next` function, but instead of returning the next (or nth) character, it returns the next (or nth) token. 
E.g. if you have the MFM `$[spin some text]`, then `$[spin`, `some text`, and `]` can be considered three different tokens. 

The parser takes in the tokens and forms the tree. This is typically a data structure the programming language understands and can more easily work with. 

### The Encoder

Once we have a good data structure, we can process this and do things with it. 
E.g. an Encoder encodes the tree into a different format. 

### The code

The code can be found in the *lib* folder. It contains, among other things, the Reader, Lexer, Parse, and Encoder modules. 

The *test* folder contains the unit tests.
